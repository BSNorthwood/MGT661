This is for the Week 3 Discussion Board
This project was to deal with a c lassification model through machine learning techniques.
The dataset used was the preexisting Iris dataset about flowers. The data set contain infromations about various species including data about maesurement taken from particular plants.
The machine learning model used was Random Forest and this was to reduce any overfitting that could have occured.
The model produce perfect classification for the setosa species while having very strong prediction capabilities for versicolor and had some troubles with virginica. Upon looking deeper ito the data this appears that some of the measurements between versicolor and virginica overlap making it more difficult for the model to determine which species a flower actually belongs in.
